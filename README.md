 ## Introduction
 This is a project that extends [GDQuests Vampire survivor clone tutorial](https://youtu.be/GwCiGixlqiU) with new things and refactors code to make it more extensible as a full game.
I'll be tracking my progress in the project board [here](https://github.com/users/Gatreh/projects/1/views/1)

 ## Purpose
 I'm mainly making this as practice and something to test out and learn new mechanics in a horde survival game context. Using it as a springboard to motivate me to do more gamedev. 

 ## How to run
 You will need Godot version 4.2 to run the project as there is no build yet, it should be able to run wherever godot can run.
 Download the project and open it up with Godot. Pressing F5 will open the main menu scene where you can start the game.
